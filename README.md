# Modeling and Forecasting USD-JPY FX Rates Using Stochastic Simulation

## Overview

This project implements stochastic simulation techniques to model and forecast the USD-JPY foreign exchange rate.  
Three stochastic models were used:

- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
- **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process**
- **GARCH(1,1) Model**

Numerical implementation was based on discretization methods, primarily the **Euler-Maruyama method** for continuous-time stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

## Data Source

Historical daily closing prices of the USD-JPY exchange rate were collected using the `yfinance` Python module, covering the period from **January 1, 2020** to **March 31, 2025**.

Data cleaning included:
- Retaining only the closing price and date columns.
- Removing missing values corresponding to non-trading days.

## Simulation Procedure

For each stochastic model:

1. **Initialization**:  
   Parameters were estimated from historical USD-JPY closing price data.

2. **Simulation**:  
   10 independent trajectories were generated for each model.  
   The final forecast trajectory was computed as the mean across all simulations to reduce stochastic noise.

3. **Evaluation**:  
   Visual comparison between actual exchange rate data and simulated paths.  
   Attempts to apply formal statistical evaluation methods (e.g., RÂ² metric, chi-squared goodness-of-fit) were made, but inconsistencies in data structures limited robust validation.

## Technical Summary

- **GBM** models simple stochastic exponential growth with constant drift and volatility, assuming log-normal price distributions.
- **OU Process** models mean-reverting behavior typical for FX rates influenced by macroeconomic equilibria.
- **GARCH(1,1)** models conditional heteroskedasticity to capture volatility clustering.

All continuous-time stochastic differential equations were discretized using the **Euler-Maruyama method**.  
The GARCH model was implemented through standard time series recursion methods.
